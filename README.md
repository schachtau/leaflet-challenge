Leaflet-Challenge

This web application is a unique, open-source, library that's purpose is to visualize earthquakes & tectonic plate activity/locations on an interactive map. 

Leaflet is the open-source library that runs on JavaScript and is a leader in interactive visualizations.

To use the Earthquake Map, just follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine, preferabky using GitDesktop.

Open the index.html file, seen under the static folder in this repository, in your web browser.

Just as you can in google maps or the maps application on your Iphone, in our map you can interact, navigate the world easily, zoom in and out for a closer look at seismic events. Choose from numerous base map options, including a street view and a black & white view to allow users the comfort of use they deserve. Additional ergonomic luxuries and features of this map allow you to toggle between earthquake data and tectonic plate boundaries using layer controls.
Earthquake locations are sized and colored relative to their magnitude and depth, providing visual cues for severity of the event and clicking on earthquake markers will show you additional information about each event.
